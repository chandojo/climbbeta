Years ago, a tree fell in front of this giant block that enabled some motivated climbers to use the fallen tree as a foundation for a radical landing platform. From the ground, roughly 9 ft below the landing, you end up actually climbing up through a large hole in the stack of sticks and logs before getting over the platform where you climb up to a very airy and committing finish. One of the best I've ever climbed in those woods!!"}, {"name": "Washington Climbing Conservation Initiative (WCCI)", "author": "Washington Climbers Coalition", "thumbnail": "https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/660853380_960x540.jpg?r=pad", "embed": "<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/238214936?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=137790\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Washington Climbing Conservation Initiative (WCCI)\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "description": "In 2017, the Washington Climbers Coalition launched the Washington Climbing Conservation Initiative (WCCI) as a regional stewardship program to address the increasing impacts of growing climbing use at cherished climbing areas across the state.
