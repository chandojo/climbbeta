In 2000 she started competing in the USA junior climbing circuit then known as the JCCA. In 2001, she began competing at an elite level and was National Champion in 2005 and won the Teva Mountain Games in 2005. After recovering from a serious finger injury in 2006, Natasha became more interested in pursuing tall beautiful lines on rock and shifted her focus on outdoor pursuits. Since then she has bouldered up to V11 on lines such at Midnight Lightning (v8), King Cobra (v8), Thriller (v10), The Force (v9/10), The Seam (v11), and Drive On (v11) and has also climbed up to 5.13d in sport and 5.11c in traditional climbing. Natasha hopes to continue pushing the limits of her climbing in all aspects, bouldering, sport and trad. She currently lives in San Francisco, California where she is working and studying full time and is 9 months away from graduating with a Doctorate in Chiropractic with a focus on Sports Medicine and Physiotherapy and spends most of her free time climbing in Yosemite Valley. \n\nFor more on Natasha visit http://www.prana.com/ambassadors/natasha-barnes\nVideo courtesy of Bruno Ferreira"}}, {"model": "video.Videos", "fields": {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fYivws5e6Y?autoplay=1&origin=climbbeta.com", "created": "2015-07-05T05:47:59.000Z", "name": "Washington Column, Yosemite Valley,CA", "city": "Yosemite Valley", "author": "ZPortalMusic .com", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8fYivws5e6Y/mqdefault.jpg", "description": "South Face 5.8 C1 Washington Column, Yosemite Valley,CA June 24th-26th 2015 Climbers & Camera Crew: Will Mcelroy & Chris Zanardi Music & Video ..."}}, {"model": "video.Videos", "fields": {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoQUnC6N1YU?autoplay=1&origin=climbbeta.com", "created": "2015-05-06T18:58:20.000Z", "name": "Rock Climbing on Munginella in Yosemite Valley", "city": "Yosemite Valley", "author": "Floyd Hayes", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GoQUnC6N1YU/mqdefault.jpg", "description": "Rock climbing on Munginella II 5.6, a three-pitch climb in Yosemite Valley, California, on 14 March 2015."}}, {"model": "video.Videos", "fields": {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JdkwJ7j5efY?autoplay=1&origin=climbbeta.com", "created": "2009-09-09T16:47:35.000Z", "name": "Journey up Washington Column - Yosemite Valley, CA", "city": "Yosemite Valley", "author": "grippedclimer", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JdkwJ7j5efY/mqdefault.jpg", "description": "My buddies and I spent several days climbing the Prow on Washington Column over Labor Day weekend 2009.
