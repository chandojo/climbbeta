The burn was very successful and a first step towards ecological restoration of the site.\n\nPrescribed fire on the landscape is a crucial management tool used to promote healthy forest ecosystems. Historically, southern Illinois upland forests, especially south and west facing slopes (as defines the Holy Boulders), burned at an interval of 3-5 years, until fire suppression in the early 20th century. Fire is necessary to promote ecologically valuable tree species (e.g. oak-hickory) and mitigate unexpected, high intensity fires by diminishing fuel loads. Furthermore, fire allows for more open and aesthetic forests, void of large amounts of downed debris.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Charles Ruffner and the SIUC Saluki Fire Dawgs.\n\nThe ICA is committed to best-management practices for Illinois' numerous climbing resources.
