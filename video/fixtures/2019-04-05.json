The burn was very successful and a first step towards ecological restoration of the site.\n\nPrescribed fire on the landscape is a crucial management tool used to promote healthy forest ecosystems. Historically, southern Illinois upland forests, especially south and west facing slopes (as defines the Holy Boulders), burned at an interval of 3-5 years, until fire suppression in the early 20th century. Fire is necessary to promote ecologically valuable tree species (e.g. oak-hickory) and mitigate unexpected, high intensity fires by diminishing fuel loads. Furthermore, fire allows for more open and aesthetic forests, void of large amounts of downed debris.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Charles Ruffner and the SIUC Saluki Fire Dawgs.\n\nThe ICA is committed to best-management practices for Illinois' numerous climbing resources.

In 2000 she started competing in the USA junior climbing circuit then known as the JCCA. In 2001, she began competing at an elite level and was National Champion in 2005 and won the Teva Mountain Games in 2005. After recovering from a serious finger injury in 2006, Natasha became more interested in pursuing tall beautiful lines on rock and shifted her focus on outdoor pursuits. Since then she has bouldered up to V11 on lines such at Midnight Lightning (v8), King Cobra (v8), Thriller (v10), The Force (v9/10), The Seam (v11), and Drive On (v11) and has also climbed up to 5.13d in sport and 5.11c in traditional climbing. Natasha hopes to continue pushing the limits of her climbing in all aspects, bouldering, sport and trad. She currently lives in San Francisco, California where she is working and studying full time and is 9 months away from graduating with a Doctorate in Chiropractic with a focus on Sports Medicine and Physiotherapy and spends most of her free time climbing in Yosemite Valley. \n\nFor more on Natasha visit http://www.prana.com/ambassadors/natasha-barnes\nVideo courtesy of Bruno Ferreira"}}, {"model": "video.Videos", "fields": {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXaEvFOsE6g?autoplay=1&origin=climbbeta.com", "created": "2016-09-16T23:11:49.000Z", "name": "Rock climbing on Commitment in Yosemite Valley, 16 April 2016", "city": "Yosemite Valley", "author": "Floyd Hayes", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aXaEvFOsE6g/mqdefault.jpg", "description": "Rock climbing with Mark Spencer on Commitment II 5.9 in Yosemite Valley, California, on 16 April 2016."}}, {"model": "video.Videos", "fields": {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEpMR86wxeQ?autoplay=1&origin=climbbeta.com", "created": "2015-06-24T06:49:51.000Z", "name": "Scale Yosemite&#39;s El Capitan in Google Maps with Alex Honnold, Lynn Hill, and Tommy Caldwell", "city": "Yosemite Valley", "author": "Google Maps", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEpMR86wxeQ/mqdefault.jpg", "description": "Get ready to climb El Capitan, a 3000 foot rock wall in Yosemite National Park, California.
